                <p>My name is Khin Yamin Htet.
                   My nickname is Yamin.
                   I was born in Monywa.
                   Currently living in Yangon.
                   As for education, I am currently in my third year at Dagon University.
                   As a distance student, I used to work at a phone shop and a children's library in my spare time.
                   At the phone shop, we sell secondhand phones so that every error related to the phone can be repaired as soon as possible and exchanged.
                   I have made errors such as phone LCD/touch and battery failure myself.
                   In the children's library, I used to work in the list section of the book entry and exit list and open brochures. <br>
                   I am currently attending a web developer course at pannacollage.org.
                   My hobby is beauty since I was young.
                   Now that I have grown up. I've become more intersted in this part of web development because I want to be able to understand the developments in line with the times and understand myself.
                   In the course I am currently attending, I am happy to meet with many new friends, so we are working together to complete the projects that we are asked to do as a group.
